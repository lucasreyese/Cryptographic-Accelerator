# Cryptographic-Accelerator
This project is done in verilog and meant to be uploaded to an FPGA to help expedite SHA-256 encryption when a process is being managed by another system.

## Demo
In order to demo this project with a DE1-SOC, use the pin planning file to load the assigments first and then upload the verilog to the board.
